## Known Issues & Solutions

| Issue | Description | Solution |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| Special Characters | Chat messages with special characters may cause test failures | Use custom Jest reporter that handles special characters:<br>1. Install reporter package<br>2. Configure Jest to use it<br>3. Run tests with --reporters flag |
| Credit System & Downtime | Credits may be consumed during service interruptions or failed flows | Currently no built-in way to track or reimburse lost credits. Consider:<br>1. Document failed flows with timestamps<br>2. Contact support for significant issues<br>3. Request status page or real-time service health indicators |
